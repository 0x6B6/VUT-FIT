# Test report

- **Author:** Marek Paz√∫r (xpazurm00)
- **Date:** 2025-05-01
- **Project:** 2. project ITS 2024/25
- **Goal:** Create automated tests in Cypress based on BDD scenarios

## Description of test modifications

- The number of tests has not changed.
- Tests in cypress files have slightly modified names compared to their gherkin counterparts
- Minor adjustments have been made to a few existing tests

Here are listed individual tests that *differ* **in Cypress**, or have been *modified* compared to their *Gherkin Scenarios*.

### book_appointment.cy.js - unregistered_user_reservation.feature

**Scenario: Only future time slots for selected date are displayed**
  - The time is not fixed at 12:00 pm, but is chosen dynamically according to the current time.

**Scenario Outline: Invalid information**
  - Invalid input data slightly differ in Cypress

**Scenario: Proceed to the Appointment Confirmation**

**Scenario: Completing the reservation**

**Scenario: Going back to the booking page for a new appointment**
  - These scenarios were merged into a single test, as each subsequent test merely extended the previous one without any changes. The new scenario covers the entire incremental logic without duplication.

### customers.cy.js - customers.feature

**Scenario Outline: Search for customer**
  - The test was expanded to include searching a list with several users present.

### calendar_reservation.cy.js - calendar_reservation.feature

**Scenario Outline: Pick existing customer**

**Scenario Outline: Creation of a customer for an appointment**
  - Unlike these Gherkin Scenarios, the tests only apply to the booking creation mode, as the form is exactly the same for the editing mode.

## Issues

There is a rare problem where the web application does not load in time and a *race condition* may occur, causing a test to return a false negative. However, efforts have been made to fix this problem.
